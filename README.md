Kotlin JavaScript with webpack minimal example
=============================

* [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org)
* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org)
* [kotlin-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jetbrains/kotlin-webpack-plugin)

It was not easy to write this example. I think the problem is in the documentation.

`build.gradle` needed to enable project as a gradle project in IDEA


## Build and run

1. npm install
2. npm run start
3. http://localhost:8080
